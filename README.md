# 100 Days of Python Challenge

Welcome to my 100 Days of Python Challenge repository! This challenge is designed to help me improve my Python programming skills over the course of 100 days.

## Overview

In this repository, you'll find:

- Daily logs of my progress
- Code snippets and projects completed during the challenge
- Resources and references I found helpful

## Rules

The rules for my 100 Days of Python Challenge are as follows:

1. **Code Every Day**: I will code for at least one hour every day.
2. **Document Progress**: I will maintain a daily log of my progress, noting what I worked on and any insights gained.
3. **Work on Projects**: I will work on projects to apply what I learn and reinforce my understanding.

## Resources

I'll be using a variety of resources to guide my learning during this challenge. Here are some of the main ones:

- [Python Documentation](https://docs.python.org/): Official documentation for Python.
- [Python.org](https://www.python.org/): The official website for the Python programming language.
- [Real Python](https://realpython.com/): A great resource for Python tutorials and articles.
- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/): A community of developers where I can ask questions and find answers.
- [100 Days of Python by Dr. Angela Yu](https://www.udemy.com/share/103IHM3@2XjhW9HfCyEre4uDfJyFpbKxbTY-CxNI8Ass-me9gBPczTNnfKztdaPlldA7cPgCIw==/): The course I will be following to guide me through this journey of learning Python.
